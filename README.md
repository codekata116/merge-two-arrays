Practice
========
* Basic git commands
* Writing solutions
* Basic runtime analysis

Rules
=====
Use any language. Clone this repository, work on a branch, and create a pull request to the master branch when you're ready for a code review (all this requires a basic understanding of git).

Given two string enumerables (suggestion: use a list or an array), write a method that returns an enumerable (same type as the input) with the contents of both arrays, but with no duplicates.

Example
-------
inputarray1 = ["hi", "dog", "bye"]
inputarray2 = ["hi", "cat", "bye"]
output = ["hi", "dog", "bye", cat"] (order does not matter)

Questions
---------
* Use a unit testing framework to write tests. What are good tests to write?
* What is the runtime of this algorithm? Can you do better?
* What modifiers does the method have (e.g. public, private, internal, virtual, static)?
* What modifiers does the class have?
